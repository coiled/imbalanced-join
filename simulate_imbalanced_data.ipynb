    "We've run into some applied situations in the wild where joins on highly imbalanced data behaves poorly in Dask. In some situtions the run time is more than desired, and in others workers may die unexpectedly. The purpose of this notebook is to create two simulated data sets that exhibits the type of problematic imbalance that we've encountred in the wild. We'll have a few parameters in here so we can create datasets of different sizes that exhibit the gnarly imbalance and these can be used for practical test cases. \n",
